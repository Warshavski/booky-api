  #
  #   Interfaces are lists of fields which may be implemented by object types.
  #
  #   An interface has fields, but it's never actually instantiated.
  #   Instead, objects may implement interfaces, which makes them a member of that interface.
  #   Also, fields may return interface types. When this happens, the returned object may be any member of that interface.
  #
  #   For example, let's say a Customer (interface) may be either an Individual (object) or a Company (object).
